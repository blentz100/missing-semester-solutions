# missing-semester-solutions
These are my solutions to the [MIT Missing Semester Course](https://missing.csail.mit.edu/). This course was offerred at MIT in January of 2020 and January of 2019 by [Anish Athalye](https://www.anishathalye.com/), [Jon Gjengset](https://thesquareplanet.com/), and [Jose Javier Gonzalez Ortiz](https://josejg.com/). The lectures, videos, and problems are all available at [https://missing.csail.mit.edu/](https://missing.csail.mit.edu/) The course consists of 10 lectures and covers the topics listed below. 

The motivation behind the course is to teach some of the tools you might be expected to know when pursuing a computer science degree, but there is no formal course that teaches them. Since this course was released to the public, many others have forked it and taught their own version of it.
